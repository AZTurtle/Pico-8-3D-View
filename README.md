# Pico-8-3D-View
#A 3D perspective program to render any shape with correct coordinates.
#Needs an implementation of all buffers (Z buffer, Y buffer, X buffer).
#Implementing textures currently.
#Currently using a very simple rasterizing method to render tris, which form the shapes.
#Trying to develop a blender (blender.org) plugin to convert 3D models into vertices.
