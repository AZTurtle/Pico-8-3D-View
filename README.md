# Pico-8-3D-View
A 3D perspective program to render any shape with correct coordinates.
Needs an implementation of all buffers (Z buffer, Y buffer, X buffer).
Implementing textures currently.
Currently using a very simple rasterizing method to render tris, which form the shapes.
The Blender plugin has been developed using python, and can be added as an addon.
